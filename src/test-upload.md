# File Upload Test Guide

## Testing Your New File Upload Feature

Your chat application now supports uploading images and videos! Here's how to test it:

### Methods to Upload Files:

1. **File Button**: Click the attachment button (ðŸ“Ž) and select image/video files
2. **Drag & Drop**: Drag image/video files directly into the chat input area
3. **Copy & Paste**: Some browsers support pasting images from clipboard

### Supported File Types:
- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .bmp, .svg
- **Videos**: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .webm, .mkv, .flv

### Features:
- âœ… **File Size Display**: Shows human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB)
- âœ… **Video Duration**: Automatically extracts and displays video length
- âœ… **Video Thumbnails**: Generates preview thumbnails for videos
- âœ… **Progress Simulation**: Shows sending â†’ sent â†’ delivered status
- âœ… **Multiple Files**: Upload several files at once
- âœ… **Memory Management**: Automatically cleans up temporary URLs
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### How It Works:
1. Select or drop files â†’ Files are processed locally
2. Preview URLs created â†’ Attachments added to message
3. Message sent â†’ Shows in chat with media previews
4. Status updates â†’ Shows delivery confirmation

### Testing Steps:
1. Open the chat application
2. Try uploading an image using the attachment button
3. Try dragging a video file into the input area
4. Upload multiple files at once
5. Verify thumbnails generate for videos
6. Check responsive behavior on mobile

The system uses Object URLs for immediate preview and simulates server upload progress. In production, you'd integrate with your actual file upload backend!

# End-to-End Encryption Implementation Guide

## Overview

Quibish now supports end-to-end encryption for secure messaging, ensuring that only intended recipients can read your messages. This implementation uses industry-standard RSA-OAEP encryption with 2048-bit keys.

## 🔒 Features

### Core Encryption Features
- **RSA-OAEP Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption with 2048-bit keys
- **Automatic Key Generation**: Keys are generated automatically when encryption is enabled
- **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are stored securely in browser localStorage
- **Public Key Exchange**: Seamless sharing of public keys between users
- **Group Messaging Support**: Encrypt messages for multiple recipients
- **Key Fingerprint Verification**: Verify user identities through key fingerprints

### User Interface Features
- **Encryption Toggle**: Easy on/off switch in message input area
- **Encryption Status Indicators**: Visual indicators showing message encryption status
- **Encryption Settings**: Comprehensive key management interface
- **Key Sharing**: Simple public key sharing and import functionality
- **Security Tab**: Dedicated security section in user profile

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Key Generation
When encryption is first enabled:
1. System generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair
2. Private key is stored securely in localStorage
3. Public key is shared with the server for other users to access

### 2. Message Encryption
When sending an encrypted message:
1. Message is encrypted using recipient's public key
2. Encrypted content is sent to server
3. Original message is displayed locally for sender
4. Recipients decrypt using their private key

### 3. Key Exchange
Public keys are exchanged automatically:
1. When a user enables encryption, their public key is uploaded
2. Other users can retrieve public keys to encrypt messages
3. Key fingerprints allow identity verification

### Core Services

#### encryptionService.js
The main encryption service handles:
- RSA key generation and management
- Message encryption/decryption
- Public key import/export
- Key fingerprint generation
- Secure storage management

#### encryptedMessageService.js
Enhanced message service that:
- Wraps existing messageService
- Adds encryption capabilities
- Handles encrypted message transmission
- Supports both direct and group messaging
- Provides fallback to unencrypted messages

### API Endpoints

#### Backend Routes (`/api/encryption/`)
- `POST /public-key` - Store user's public key
- `GET /public-key/:userId` - Get user's public key
- `POST /public-keys` - Get multiple users' public keys
- `GET /my-public-key` - Get own public key
- `DELETE /public-key` - Delete public key
- `POST /verify-fingerprint` - Verify key fingerprint
- `GET /status` - Get encryption status
- `GET /health` - Health check

## 🔧 Usage Guide

### For Users

#### Enabling Encryption
1. Open your user profile
2. Click the "Security" tab
3. Click "Initialize Encryption"
4. Your keys will be generated automatically

#### Sending Encrypted Messages
1. Look for the lock icon (🔒/🔓) in the message input area
2. Click to toggle encryption on/off
3. When enabled (🔒), messages are encrypted automatically
4. When disabled (🔓), messages are sent normally

#### Understanding Message Status
- 🔒 **Encrypted & Sent**: Message was encrypted and sent
- 🔓 **Decrypted**: Received encrypted message, successfully decrypted
- ⚠️ **Decryption Failed**: Unable to decrypt received message
- 🔐 **Encrypted**: Message is encrypted (general indicator)

#### Key Management
1. Access encryption settings from user profile → Security tab
2. View your public key and fingerprint
3. Share your public key with contacts
4. Verify other users' key fingerprints
5. Regenerate keys if needed

### For Developers

#### Initializing Encryption
```javascript
import encryptedMessageService from './services/encryptedMessageService';

// Initialize encryption for current user
const success = await encryptedMessageService.initializeEncryption(userId);
```

#### Sending Encrypted Messages
```javascript
// Send encrypted message
const message = await encryptedMessageService.sendMessage(
  { text: "Hello, secure world!" },
  { 
    encrypt: true, 
    recipientId: "user123" 
  }
);
```

#### Getting Encryption Status
```javascript
const status = encryptedMessageService.getEncryptionStatus();
console.log('Encryption enabled:', status.enabled);
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Key Security
- **Private Keys**: Never leave the user's device
- **Public Keys**: Shared freely for encryption purposes
- **Key Storage**: Uses browser localStorage with base64 encoding
- **Key Size**: 2048-bit RSA keys provide strong security

### Message Security
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses the recipient's current public key
- **No Server Decryption**: Server cannot decrypt messages
- **Client-Side Only**: All encryption/decryption happens in the browser

### Best Practices
1. **Verify Fingerprints**: Always verify key fingerprints with contacts
2. **Secure Backup**: Consider backing up keys securely
3. **Regular Updates**: Regenerate keys periodically for maximum security
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all communications

## 🚨 Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Key Recovery**: Lost keys mean lost access to encrypted messages
- **Browser Storage**: Keys are tied to specific browser/device
- **No Key Backup**: Automatic key backup not implemented
- **Group Key Management**: Group encryption uses individual key pairs

### Future Enhancements
- Key backup and recovery system
- Cross-device key synchronization
- Enhanced group key management
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Message expiration/auto-deletion

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Enable encryption for two different users
2. Send encrypted messages between them
3. Verify encryption indicators appear
4. Test key fingerprint verification
5. Try group messaging with encryption

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 37+ (Web Crypto API support)
- Firefox 34+
- Safari 7+
- Edge 12+

## 📚 Technical References

### Encryption Standards
- **RSA-OAEP**: RFC 3447 - PKCS #1 v2.1
- **Key Size**: 2048-bit minimum recommended
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256

### Web APIs Used
- **Web Crypto API**: For cryptographic operations
- **localStorage**: For secure key storage
- **TextEncoder/Decoder**: For string/binary conversion

## 🔄 Migration & Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- Unencrypted messages continue to work normally
- Encryption is opt-in, not mandatory
- Existing message history remains accessible

### Data Migration
- No migration needed for existing messages
- Encryption applies only to new messages after enablement

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Encryption Failed**: Check if recipient has encryption enabled
2. **Decryption Failed**: Verify you have the correct private key
3. **Key Not Found**: Ensure public key exchange completed successfully
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Verify Web Crypto API support

### Error Messages
- "Cannot encrypt for user X": User hasn't enabled encryption
- "Decryption error": Message cannot be decrypted with current keys
- "Key generation failed": Browser doesn't support required cryptography

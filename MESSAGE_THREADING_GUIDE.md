## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Handler → Service → IndexedDB
                ↓
            Event Fired
                ↓
          State Updated
                ↓
           UI Re-renders
```

### Thread Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "thread_1234567890",
  parentMessage: {
    id: "msg_1234",
    text: "Original message",
    user: { id: "user1", name: "John" },
    timestamp: "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
    reactions: []
  },
  replies: [
    {
      id: 1234567891,
      text: "First reply",
      user: { id: "user2", name: "Jane" },
      timestamp: "2025-10-01T10:31:00Z",
      reactions: []
    }
  ],
  replyCount: 1,
  participants: Set(["user1", "user2"]),
  conversationId: "conv_123",
  isCollapsed: false,
  createdAt: "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-01T10:31:00Z"
}
```

### IndexedDB Schema

**Database**: `QuibishThreads`
**Version**: 1

**Object Stores**:
- `threads` (keyPath: `id`)
  - Index: `conversationId` (for filtering)
  - Index: `updatedAt` (for sorting)

### Event System

**Events Fired**:
- `onThreadCreated(thread)` - When thread is created
- `onReplyAdded(threadId)` - When reply is added
- `onThreadUpdated(thread)` - When thread is modified
- `onThreadDeleted(threadId)` - When thread is deleted

**Event Subscribers** (in ProChat):
```javascript
messageThreadService.onThreadCreated = handleThreadCreated;
messageThreadService.onReplyAdded = handleReplyAdded;
messageThreadService.onThreadUpdated = handleThreadUpdated;
messageThreadService.onThreadDeleted = handleThreadDeleted;
```

console.log('Thread created:', thread.id);
```

**Adding Replies:**
```javascript
const reply = {
  id: Date.now(),
  text: "This is my reply",
  user: currentUser,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  reactions: []
};

messageThreadService.addReply(threadId, reply);
```

**Listening to Events:**
```javascript
messageThreadService.onThreadCreated = (thread) => {
  console.log('New thread:', thread.id);
  // Update UI
};

messageThreadService.onReplyAdded = (threadId) => {
  console.log('New reply in thread:', threadId);
  // Update UI
};
```

**Retrieving Threads:**
```javascript
// Get single thread
const thread = messageThreadService.getThread(threadId);

// Get all threads for conversation
const threads = messageThreadService.getThreadsForConversation(conversationId);

// Search threads
const results = messageThreadService.searchThreads("search term");

// Get thread statistics
const stats = messageThreadService.getThreadStats();
console.log(`Total threads: ${stats.totalThreads}`);
console.log(`Active threads: ${stats.activeThreads}`);
```

**Export/Import:**
```javascript
// Export threads for backup
const exportData = messageThreadService.exportThreads();
localStorage.setItem('thread_backup', JSON.stringify(exportData));

// Import threads from backup
const backupData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('thread_backup'));
const result = messageThreadService.importThreads(backupData);
console.log(`Imported ${result.imported} threads`);
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Local Storage Only** - Threads stored in browser's IndexedDB only
   - Not synced across devices yet
   - Lost if browser cache cleared
   - Requires export/import for backup

2. **Flat Reply Structure** - No nested replies within threads
   - All replies are at same level
   - Cannot reply to specific reply
   - Thread depth is limited to 2 levels (parent + replies)

3. **No Rich Text** - Plain text replies only
   - No markdown support
   - No code syntax highlighting
   - No inline images/videos

4. **No Real-time Updates** - Manual refresh required
   - Thread updates don't sync automatically
   - Need to reload page to see others' replies
   - No WebSocket/SSE integration yet

### Known Bugs
- None reported yet (freshly implemented)

### Browser Compatibility Issues
- **Safari < 14**: IndexedDB may have limited support

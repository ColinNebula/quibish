**Key Capabilities:**
- **Automatic Reconnection:** Uses exponential backoff strategy
- **Connection Quality Monitoring:** Measures latency and success rates
- **Heartbeat Mechanism:** Detects dead connections
- **Offline Mode:** Allows users to work offline with message queuing
- **Network Type Detection:** Adapts behavior based on network conditions
- **Detailed Metrics:** Tracks connection performance statistics
- **Event System:** Notifies components of connection status changes

### 2. Enhanced Connection Monitor UI

**Purpose:** Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing connection status.

**Key Features:**
- **Expandable Interface:** Compact when collapsed, detailed when expanded
- **Visual Status Indicators:** Clear visual cues about connection state
- **Multiple Information Tabs:** Overview, Metrics, and Diagnostics views
- **Connection Controls:** Manual reconnect and offline mode toggles
- **Detailed Metrics Display:** Shows comprehensive connection statistics
- **Connection History:** Log of recent connection events
- **Diagnostic Tools:** Self-diagnostic capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Setting Up the WebSocket Service

The enhanced WebSocket service should be initialized at the application level or in a major component like `Home`:

```javascript
// Initialize at application startup
enhancedWebSocketService.initialize({
  url: 'ws://your-server-url/ws',
  reconnectOptions: {
    maxAttempts: 10,
    initialDelay: 1000,
    maxDelay: 30000
  },
  heartbeatInterval: 30000,
  offlineSupport: true
});
```

### Listening for Connection Events

```javascript
// Add a connection state listener
const unsubscribe = enhancedWebSocketService.addConnectionStateListener(
  (connected, details) => {
    // Update UI or application state
    console.log('Connection state changed:', connected, details);
    
    if (connected && details.wasReconnect) {
      // We just reconnected - sync any offline data
      syncOfflineMessages();
    }
  }
);

// Later, when cleaning up:
unsubscribe();
```

### Sending Messages

```javascript
// Send a message with handling for offline mode
const sendMessage = async (message) => {
  try {
    if (enhancedWebSocketService.isConnected()) {
      await enhancedWebSocketService.send(message);
      // Message sent successfully
    } else {
      // Store message for later sending
      await userDataService.storePendingMessage(message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send message:', error);
    // Store for later retry
    await userDataService.storePendingMessage(message);
  }
};
```

### Handling Reconnection

The service automatically attempts reconnection, but you can also trigger it manually:

```javascript
const handleManualReconnect = async () => {
  try {
    const success = await enhancedWebSocketService.reconnect();
    if (success) {
      console.log('Successfully reconnected');
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to reconnect');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Reconnection error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Adding the Connection Monitor to UI

```jsx
// In your component's render method:
<EnhancedConnectionMonitor 
  expanded={false} 
  onStatusChange={handleConnectionStatusChange}
  showControls={true}
/>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Early:** Set up the WebSocket service early in application lifecycle
2. **Clean Up Properly:** Unsubscribe listeners and disconnect when components unmount
3. **Handle Offline Mode Gracefully:** Always check connection status before sending
4. **Store Messages Locally:** Cache messages for offline support
5. **Sync on Reconnect:** Implement logic to sync data when connection is restored
6. **Provide Visual Feedback:** Always show connection status to users
7. **Adapt to Connection Quality:** Reduce features or data transfer when connection is poor

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Frequent Disconnections**
   - Check network stability
   - Verify server WebSocket implementation
   - Adjust heartbeat interval (may need to be shorter)

2. **Messages Not Sending**
   - Confirm WebSocket connection is established
   - Check message format
   - Verify offline message storage is working correctly

3. **High Latency**
   - Monitor network conditions
   - Check for server load issues
   - Consider reducing message size or frequency

### Debugging Tools

The `EnhancedConnectionMonitor` component provides several debugging tools:

1. **Connection Metrics:** Check latency, uptime, and message statistics
2. **Diagnostic View:** Shows detailed connection information
3. **Manual Ping:** Test connection response time
4. **Log Diagnostics:** Outputs detailed diagnostic information to console

## Future Enhancements

1. **Connection Quality Prediction:** Use AI to predict connection issues before they occur
2. **Bandwidth Optimization:** Adapt message size based on connection quality
3. **Connection Analytics:** Track and analyze connection patterns over time
4. **Custom Retry Strategies:** Allow defining custom reconnection strategies
5. **Multiple Simultaneous Connections:** Support for multiple WebSocket connections

## Conclusion

This enhanced connection handling system significantly improves the reliability and user experience of the Quibish application, especially in challenging network conditions. By implementing proper offline support, reconnection strategies, and providing clear feedback to users, the application can maintain functionality even when network connectivity is inconsistent.
